## What {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.5 offers
{: #console-ocp-about-offers}

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform provides a flexible management platform that runs on Kubernetes. The offering includes an award-winning management console that allows you to easily deploy blockchain components, build a multicloud blockchain network, and perform network management and maintenance.

This offering includes two deployment options:  

**Full platform**

Includes the operator, management console, peer, CA, orderer, and smart contract container images. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform management console can be used to create all of the fundamental components of a Hyperledger Fabric network: a Certificate Authority (CA), an ordering service, and peers, on your local cluster. You can also use your console to operate a distributed multicloud network by importing nodes that were deployed by using other consoles. For more information about the building blocks of Hyperledger Fabric networks, see the [blockchain component overview](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-blockchain-component-overview).

**{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} images**  

For experienced Hyperledger Fabric customers, a purchase of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.5 includes an entitlement to the peer, CA, orderer, and smart contract container images that are signed and supported by {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. These images are based on the open source Hyperledger Fabric code base and contain a number of enhancements for stability and serviceability. The images are bundled with support from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform management console and operator are not among the images that are included in this entitlement. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} images for Hyperledger Fabric](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-blockchain-images#blockchain-images).

The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform includes the following key features:

**BUILD ---- Integrated developer experience**
- **Deploy easily**. Use Ansible Playbooks to deploy networks quicker than ever before.
- **Easily code** your smart contracts in Node.js, Golang, Java, or JavaScript. Use the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform Developer Tools to easily develop smart contracts locally or use Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces to develop them in the cloud. Leverage **SDK integration** with the console, and learn from our rich tutorials and samples.
- **Simplified DevOps** allows you to move from development to test to production in a single environment by scaling up your Kubernetes resources to add more components.
- **Up-to-date Fabric key features**. Choose which version of Hyperledger Fabric you want to use when deploying peers or ordering nodes. Leverage the latest features of Hyperledger Fabric v1.4.7 and v2.x:
  - [Raft ordering service](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/orderer/ordering_service.html#raft){: external}
  - [Private data collections](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-ibp-console-smart-contracts#ibp-console-smart-contracts-private-data) that provide increased data privacy by ensuring that ledger data is shared to only authorized peers via the gossip protocol.
  - [Fabric Node OUs](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/membership/membership.html#node-ou-roles-and-msps){: external}
  - [Service discovery](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/discovery-overview.html){: external}, allowing you to dynamically discover and update how your application interacts with your network.
  - [Channel access control lists](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/access_control.html){: external} that allow you additional control of the governance of your channels and smart contracts.

**OPERATE --- Total control of your deployments**
- **Host or join a network**. Deploy peers that are hosted in your cluster to multiple channels on multiple clouds, or invite other organizations to join your consortium or channels while the organizations manage their nodes independently across infrastructures.
- **Maintain complete control of your identities**. Store and manage the keys that are used to administer your nodes. Optionally, use an [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](#x6704988){: term} to generate and store the private key of your nodes.
- **Run Anywhere**. Thanks to the **unified codebase** of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console, it is possible to run your components on any Kubernetes v1.15 - v1.18 container platform on x86_64 or s390x.
- **Unified operation**. The {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform console allows you to deploy and manage all of your organizations and nodes in **one console**. You can also add or remove members from a blockchain consortium, create and join channels, and install and instantiate smart contracts from your console.
- **Dynamic signature collection** that allows better control over collaborative governance over channel configurations.
- **Elimination of Docker-in-Docker for smart contracts** allows smart contract pods to be run more securely, without peers needing privileged access.
- **Manage access** of the users who can administer or monitor your nodes.
- **Interact directly with your pods** using your Kubernetes service.
- **Direct access to the logs** of your nodes from your  Kubernetes service. Use  any supported third-party service to extract and analyze your logs.
- **Kubernetes service integration.** Leverage services such as LogDNA for logging and Prometheus and Sysdig for monitoring.

**GROW --- Scalability and flexibility**
- **Choose your compute**. You have the flexibility to decide the amount of CPU, memory, and storage you want to provision in your Kubernetes cluster. For more information, see [Allocating resources](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-ibp-console-adv-deployment#ibp-console-adv-deployment-allocate-resources).
- **Scale** up and down the resources in your Kubernetes cluster, paying for only what you need. For more information, see  [Pricing](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-ibp-sw-pricing).
- **Disaster recovery and multi-region high availability (HA).** This option duplicates your Kubernetes deployment across  regions, enabling high availability (HA) of your components and disaster recovery (DR).
- **Connect to other Fabric networks**: Join {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform peers to any network running Hyperledger Fabric components. Similarly, you can invite Fabric peers to join channels hosted on an ordering service deployed on the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform. Note that you will need to use Hyperledger Fabric APIs or the CLI.
