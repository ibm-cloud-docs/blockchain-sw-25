{{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.1 now provides users the ability to deploy the blockchain components on any Kubernetes v1.11 - v1.16 container platform on x86_64 hardware. Your entitlement includes the peer, CA, ordering node, and smart contract container images as well as the award-winning flexible management console for deploying and managing your blockchain network. Use the console or IBM Blockchain Platform APIs to build a consortium of organizations to easily transact on the same network, regardless of each client's cloud preference. Clients can build, operate, and grow their blockchain networks with an offering that can be used from development to production.

If you are an experienced Hyperledger Fabric customer and prefer to deploy and manage the containers yourself, you can download and use the container images without the management console. For more information, see [Using the IBM Blockchain images](/docs/blockchain-sw-213?topic=blockchain-sw-213-blockchain-images).

If you are an existing {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.1.0 customer, there is no upgrade needed to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.1.
