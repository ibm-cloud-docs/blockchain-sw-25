If you are using {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.0 or v2.1.1, you cannot access the console from the Chrome browser on Mac OS Catalina when the console is deployed with the default configuration that uses self-signed certificates. For more information on how you can resolve this problem, see [Chrome browser on Mac OS Catalina](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-sw-known-issues#sw-known-issues-catalina) in Known Issues.
{:note}

## Upgrade to the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform 2.5
{: #upgrade-k8-steps}

You can upgrade an {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform network by using the following steps:

1. [Update the ClusterRole](#upgrade-k8-clusterrole)
2. [Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator](#upgrade-ocp-operator)
3. [Use your console to upgrade your running blockchain nodes](#upgrade-ocp-nodes)

After you upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator, the operator will automatically upgrade the console that is deployed on your namespace. You can then use the upgraded console to upgrade your blockchain nodes.

You need to complete these steps for each network that that runs on a separate namespace. If you experience any problems, see the instructions for [rolling back an upgrade](#upgrade-k8-rollback). If you deployed your network behind a firewall, without access to the external internet, see the separate set of instructions for [Upgrading the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform behind a firewall](#upgrade-k8-firewall).

You can continue to submit transactions to your network while you are upgrading your network. However, you cannot use the console to deploy new nodes, install or instantiate smart contracts, or create new channels during the upgrade process.

### Roll back an upgrade
{: #upgrade-k8-rollback}

When you upgrade your operator, it saves the secrets, deployment spec, and network information of your console before it the operator attempts to upgrade the console. If your upgrade fails for any reason, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Support can roll back your upgrade and restore your previous deployment by using the information on your cluster. If you need to roll back your upgrade, you can submit a support case from the [mysupport](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/support-ibm-blockchain-platform-v21x){: external} page.

You can roll back an upgrade after you use the console to operate your network. However, after you use the console to upgrade your blockchain nodes, you can no longer roll back your console to a previous version of the platform.

## Before you begin

To upgrade your network, you need to [retrieve your entitlement key](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-deploy-k8#deploy-k8-entitlement-key) from the My {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Dashboard, and [create a Kubernetes secret](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-deploy-k8#deploy-k8-docker-registry-secret) to store the key on your namespace. If the Entitlement key secret was removed from your cluster, or if your key is expired, then you need to download another key and create a new secret.

Occasionally, a five node ordering service that was deployed using v2.1.2 will be deleted by the Kubernetes garbage collector because it considers the nodes a resource that needs to be cleaned up. This process is both random and unrecoverable --- if the ordering service is deleted, all of the channels hosted on it are permanently lost. To prevent this, the `ownerReferences` field in the configuration of each ordering node must be removed **before upgrading to v2.1.3**. For the steps about how to pull the configuration file, remove `ordererReferences`, and apply the change, see [Known issues](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain-sw?topic=blockchain-sw-sw-known-issues#sw-known-issues-ordering-service-delete) in the v2.1.2 documentation.
{:important}

Updating the Operator triggers a restart of all components managed by this installation of the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform including Fabric nodes. To avoid disruption of service, a multiregion setup is recommended.
{: note}

## Step one: Update the ClusterRole
{: #upgrade-k8-clusterrole}

This step is only required if you are upgrading from v2.1.0 or v2.1.1. If you are running v2.1.2 you can skip to [Step two](#upgrade-k8-operator).
{: note}

You need to update the ClusterRole that is applied to your project. Copy the following text to a file on your local system and save the file as `ibp-clusterrole.yaml`. Edit the file and replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your project.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <NAMESPACE>
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - apiextensions.k8s.io
  resources:
  - persistentvolumeclaims
  - persistentvolumes
  - customresourcedefinitions
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - "*"
  resources:
  - pods
  - pods/log
  - services
  - endpoints
  - persistentvolumeclaims
  - persistentvolumes
  - events
  - configmaps
  - secrets
  - ingresses
  - roles
  - rolebindings
  - serviceaccounts
  - nodes
  - routes
  - routes/custom-host

  resources:
  - '*'
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - config.openshift.io
  resources:
  - '*'
  verbs:
  - '*'
```
{:codeblock}

After you save and edit the file, run the following commands. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your Kubernetes namespace.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-clusterrole.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

## Step two: Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} operator
{: #upgrade-k8-operator}

You can upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} operator by fetching the operator deployment spec from your cluster. When the upgraded operator is running, the new operator will upgrade your console and download the latest images for your blockchain nodes.

Log in to your cluster by using the kubectl CLI. Because each {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} network runs in a different namespace, you must switch to each namespace and upgrade each network separately. use the following command to set the context to the namespace of the network that you want to upgrade. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

When you are operating from your namespace, run the following command to download the operator deployment spec to your local file system:
```
kubectl get deployment ibp-operator -o yaml > operator.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

Open `operator.yaml` in a text editor and save a new copy of the file as `operator-upgrade.yaml`. You need to update the `image:` field with the updated version of the operator image. You can find the name and tag of the latest operator image below:
```
cp.icr.io/cp/ibp-operator:2.5.0-20200618-amd64
```
{:codeblock}

You also need to edit the `env:` section of the file. Find the following lines in `operator-upgrade.yaml`:
```
- name: ISOPENSHIFT
  value: "false"
```
{:codeblock}

Replace the values above with the following lines at the same indentation:
```
- name: CLUSTERTYPE
  value: <CLUSTER_TYPE>
```
{:codeblock}

- Replace `<CLUSTER_TYPE>` with `K8S` if you are deploying the platform on open source Kubernetes or Rancher.

When you are finished editing the file, the `env:` section would look similar to the following:
```
env:
- name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.name
- name: OPERATOR_NAME
  value: ibp-operator
- name: CLUSTERTYPE
  value: K8S
```
{:codeblock}

Save the file on your local system. You can then issue the following command upgrade your operator:
```
kubectl apply -f operator-upgrade.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

You can use the `kubectl get deployment ibp-operator -o yaml` command to confirm that the command updated the operator spec.

After you apply the `operator-upgrade.yaml` operator spec to your namespace, the operator will restart and pull the latest image. The upgrade takes about a minute. While the upgrade is taking place, you can still access your console UI. However, you cannot use the console to install and instantiate chaincode, or use the console or the APIs to create or remove a node.

You can check that the upgrade is complete by running `kubectl get deployment ibp-operator`. If the upgrade is successful, then you can see the following tables with four ones displayed for your operator and your console.
```
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ibp-operator   1         1         1            1           1m
ibpconsole     1         1         1            1           8m
```

If you experience a problem while you are upgrading the operator, go to this [troubleshooting topic](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-ibp-v2-troubleshooting#ibp-v2-troubleshooting-deployment-cr) for a list of commonly encountered problems. You can run the command to apply the original operator file, `kubectl apply -f operator.yaml` to restore your original operator deployment.

## Step three: Upgrade your blockchain nodes
{: #upgrade-k8-nodes}

After you upgrade your console, you can use the console UI to upgrade the nodes of your blockchain network. Browse to the console UI and open the nodes overview tab. You can find the **Patch available** text on a node tile if there is an update available for the component. You can install this patch whenever you are ready. These patches are optional, but they are recommended. You cannot patch nodes that were imported into the console.

Apply patches to nodes one at a time. Your nodes are unavailable to process requests or transactions while the patch is being applied. Therefore, to avoid any disruption of service, you need to ensure that another node of the same type is available to process requests whenever possible. Installing patches on a node takes about a minute to complete and when the update is complete, the node is ready to process requests.
{:important}

To apply a patch to a node, open the node tile and click the **Install patch** button. You cannot patch nodes that you imported to the console.

## Upgrading the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform behind a firewall
{: #upgrade-k8-firewall}

If you deployed the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform behind a firewall, without access to the external internet, you can upgrade your network by using the following steps:

1. [Pull the latest {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform images](#upgrade-k8-images-firewall)
2. [Update the ClusterRole](#upgrade-k8-clusterrole-firewall)
3. [Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform operator](#upgrade-k8-operator-firewall)
4. [Use your console to upgrade your running blockchain nodes](#upgrade-k8-nodes-firewall)

You can continue to submit transactions to your network while you are upgrading your network. However, you cannot use the console to deploy new nodes, install or instantiate smart contracts, or create new channels during the upgrade process.

### Before you begin
{: #upgrade-k8-begin-firewall}

To upgrade your network, you need to [retrieve your entitlement key](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-deploy-k8-firewall#deploy-k8-entitlement-key-firewall) from the My {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Dashboard, and [create a Kubernetes secret](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-deploy-k8#deploy-k8-docker-registry-secret) to store the key on your namespace. If the Entitlement key secret was removed from your cluster, or if your key is expired, then you need to download another key and create a new secret.

### Step one: Pull the latest {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform images
{: #upgrade-k8-images-firewall}

To upgrade your network, download the latest set of {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform images and push them to a docker registry that you can access from behind your firewall.

Use the following command to log in to the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Entitlement Registry:
```
docker login --username cp --password <KEY> cp.icr.io
```
{:codeblock}

- Replace `<KEY>` with your entitlement key.

After you log in, use the following command to pull the images for {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.3:
```
docker pull cp.icr.io/cp/ibp-operator:2.5.0-20200618-amd64

docker pull cp.icr.io/cp/ibp-javaenv:2.1.1-20200618-amd64
```
{:codeblock}

After you download the images, you must change the image tags to refer to your docker registry. Replace `<LOCAL_REGISTRY>` with the url of your local registry and run the following commands:
```

You can use the `docker images` command to check that the new tags were added. You can then push the images with the new tags to your docker registry. Log in to your registry by using the following command:
```
docker login --username <USER> --password <LOCAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD> <LOCAL_REGISTRY>
```
{:codeblock}

- Replace `<USER>` with your username
- Replace `<LOCAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD>` with the password to your registry.
- Replace `<LOCAL_REGISTRY>` with the url of your local registry.

Then, run the following command to push the images. Replace `<LOCAL_REGISTRY>` with the url of your local registry.
```
docker push <LOCAL_REGISTRY>/ibp-operator:2.5.0-20200618-amd64
docker push <LOCAL_REGISTRY>/ibp-init:2.5.0-20200618-amd64

After you complete these steps, you can use the following instructions to deploy the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform with the images in your registry.

### Step two: Update the ClusterRole
{: #upgrade-k8-fw-clusterrole}

This step is only required if you are upgrading from v2.1.0 or v2.1.1. If you are running v2.1.2 you can skip to [Step three](#upgrade-k8-operator-firewall).
{: note}

You need to update the ClusterRole that is applied to your project. Copy the following text to a file on your local system and save the file as `ibp-clusterrole.yaml`. Edit the file and replace `<NAMESPACE>` with the name of your project.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <NAMESPACE>
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - apiextensions.k8s.io
  resources:
  - persistentvolumeclaims
  - persistentvolumes
  - customresourcedefinitions
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - "*"
  resources:
  - pods
  - pods/log
  - services
  - endpoints
  - persistentvolumeclaims
  - persistentvolumes
  - events
  - configmaps
  - secrets
  - ingresses
  - roles
  - rolebindings
  - serviceaccounts
  - nodes
  - routes
  - routes/custom-host
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  resources:
  - namespaces
  - nodes
  verbs:
  - get
- apiGroups:
  - apps
  resources:
  - deployments
  - daemonsets
  - replicasets
  - statefulsets
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - monitoring.coreos.com
  resources:
  - servicemonitors
  verbs:
  - get
  - create
- apiGroups:
  - apps
  resourceNames:
  - ibp-operator
  resources:
  - deployments/finalizers
  verbs:
  - update
- apiGroups:
  - ibp.com
  resources:
  - '*'
  - ibpservices
  - ibpcas
  - ibppeers
  - ibpfabproxies
  - ibporderers
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - ibp.com
  resources:
  - '*'
  verbs:
  - '*'
- apiGroups:
  - config.openshift.io
  resources:
  - '*'
  verbs:
  - '*'
```
{:codeblock}

After you save and edit the file, run the following commands. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your Kubernetes namespace.
```
kubectl apply -f ibp-clusterrole.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

### Step three: Upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} operator
{: #upgrade-k8-operator-firewall}

You can upgrade the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} operator by fetching the operator deployment spec from your cluster. You can then update the spec with the latest operator image that you pushed to your local registry. When the upgraded operator is running, the new operator will download the images that you pushed to your local registry and upgrade your console.

Log in to your cluster by using the kubectl CLI. Because each {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} network runs in a different namespace, you must switch to each namespace and upgrade each network separately. use the following command to set the context to the namespace of the network that you want to upgrade. Replace `<NAMESPACE>` with your namespace.
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<NAMESPACE>
```
{:codeblock}

When you are operating from your namespace, run the following command to download the operator deployment spec to your local file system:
```
kubectl get deployment ibp-operator -o yaml > operator.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

Open `operator.yaml` in a text editor and save a new copy of the file as `operator-upgrade.yaml`. You need to update the `image:` field with the updated version of the operator image:
```
<LOCAL_REGISTRY>/ibp-operator:2.5.0-20200618-amd64
```
{:codeblock}

You also need to edit the `env:` section of the file. Find the following lines in `operator-upgrade.yaml`:
```
- name: ISOPENSHIFT
  value: "false"
```
{:codeblock}

Replace the values above with the following lines at the same indentation:
```
- name: CLUSTERTYPE
  value: <CLUSTER_TYPE>
```
{:codeblock}

- Replace `<CLUSTER_TYPE>` with `K8S` if you are deploying the platform on open source Kubernetes or Rancher.

When you are finished editing the file, the `env:` section would look similar to the following:
```
env:
- name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
- name: POD_NAME
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      fieldPath: metadata.name
- name: OPERATOR_NAME
  value: ibp-operator
- name: CLUSTERTYPE
  value: K8S
```
{:codeblock}

Save the file on your local system. You can then issue the following command upgrade your operator:
```
kubectl apply -f operator-upgrade.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

You can use the `kubectl get deployment ibp-operator -o yaml` command to confirm that the command updated the operator spec.

After you apply the `operator-upgrade.yaml` deployment spec to your namespace, the operator will restart and pull the latest image. The upgrade takes about a minute. While the upgrade is taking place, you can still access your console UI. However, you cannot use the console to install and instantiate chaincode, or use the console or the APIs to create or remove a node.

You can check that the upgrade is complete by running `kubectl get deployment ibp-operator`. If the upgrade is successful, then you can see the following tables with four ones displayed for your operator and your console.
```
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
ibp-operator   1         1         1            1           1m
ibpconsole     1         1         1            1           8m
```

If you experience a problem while you are upgrading the operator, go to this [troubleshooting topic](/docs/blockchain-sw-25?topic=blockchain-sw-25-ibp-v2-troubleshooting#ibp-v2-troubleshooting-deployment-cr) for a list of commonly encountered problems.

If your console experiences an image pull error, you may need to update the console deployment spec with local registry that you used to download the images. Run the following command to download the deployment spec of the console:
```
kubectl get ibpconsole ibpconsole -o yaml > console.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

Then add the URL of your local registry to the `spec:` section of `console.yaml`. Replace `<LOCAL_REGISTRY>` with the url of your local registry:
```
spec:
  registryURL: <LOCAL_REGISTRY>
```
{:codeblock}

Save the updated file as `console-upgrade.yaml` on your local system. You can then issue the following command upgrade your console:
```
kubectl apply -f console-upgrade.yaml
```
{:codeblock}

### Step four: Upgrade your blockchain nodes
{: #upgrade-k8-nodes-firewall}

After you upgrade your console, you can use the console UI to upgrade the nodes of your blockchain network. For more information, see [Upgrade your blockchain nodes](#upgrade-k8-nodes).
