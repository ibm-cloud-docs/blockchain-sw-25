## Certicicate Authority patch install fails
{: #sw-known-issues-ca-upgrade}

After upgrading from {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.2 to v2.1.3, installing the patch on a CA node fails. To resolve this problem see the [Troubleshooting](/docs/blockchain-sw-213?topic=blockchain-sw-213-ibp-v2-troubleshooting#ibp-v2-troubleshooting-ca-upgrade-fails) topic.

## Chrome browser on Mac OS Catalina
{: #sw-known-issues-catalina}

The console will not work in the Chrome browser on Mac OS Catalina when the {{site.data.keyword.blockchainfull_notm}} Platform v2.1.0 or v2.1.1 is deployed with the default configuration that uses self-signed certificates. There are three ways to resolve this problem:

1.  Use a different [supported browser](/docs/blockchain-sw-213?topic=blockchain-sw-213-deploy-ocp#deploy-ocp-browsers) with Catalina.
2. Use your own [TLS certificates when deploying on OpenShift Container Platform](/docs/blockchain-sw-213?topic=blockchain-sw-213-deploy-ocp#use-your-own-tls-certificates-optional-) or [TLS certificates when deploying on Kubernetes or {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Private](/docs/blockchain-sw-213?topic=blockchain-sw-213-deploy-k8#use-your-own-tls-certificates-optional-).
3. Run the following commands to generate a new key and certificate pair for the console that will fix the problem.
   1. Run the following command to get the pod that corresponds to the console:
      ```
      kubectl get po
      ```
      {: codeblock}
   2. Exec into the pod by running the command:
      ```
      kubectl get po <pod-name> -c optools bash
      ```
      {: codeblock}
   3. Delete the console key and certificate by running the command:
      ```
      rm -f /certs/tls.key rm -f /certs/tls.crt
      ```
      {: codeblock}
   4. Delete the console pod which causes it to restart by running the command:
      ```
      kubectl delete po <pod-name>
      ```
      {: codeblock}
    When the pod restart completes, you should now be able to log in to your console URL from a Chrome Browser.
